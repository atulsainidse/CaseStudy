## Lasso Feature Selection
With over 500 features, it's important to reduce the feature-set to avoid overfitting and to create a sensical model. The more features you have, the easier it is to create a model that trains well, but may not do so well with test data. To learn more about these problems, checkout the bias-variance trade-off and the curse of dimensionality.
Lasso selection works by reducing the coefficients of certain features towards (and exactly) 0. The higher the lambda, the faster this will happen. A sufficiently high lamba would set all features to 0, meaning only the coefficient will be used in the model (a simple mean, for example, in regression).
```{r}
x <- model.matrix(y_train ~ ., X_train)[,-1]
dim(x)
```

```{r}
fit = glmnet(x, y_train, family = "multinomial", type.multinomial = "grouped")
```



```{r}
rm(fit)

attributeNames = features$feature
```
